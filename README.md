# Introduction to Statistical Learning - Applied Exercises

This repository contains my solutions to all the applied exercises from the book *An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python*. The purpose of this project is to practice and solidify concepts in statistical learning by implementing and solving the exercises using Python.

## Structure
The exercises are organized by chapter, each with its own folder:

- **Chapter 1: Introduction**
  - No applied exercises
- **Chapter 2: Statistical Learning**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_2/`
- **Chapter 3: Linear Regression**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_3/`
- **Chapter 4: Classification**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_4/`
- **Chapter 5: Resampling Methods**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_5/`
- **Chapter 6: Linear Model Selection and Regularization**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_6/`
- **Chapter 7: Moving Beyond Linearity**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_7/`
- **Chapter 8: Tree-Based Methods**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_8/`
- **Chapter 9: Support Vector Machines**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_9/`
- **Chapter 10: Unsupervised Learning**
  - Folder: `/Chapter_10/`

Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`) with solutions to the applied exercises of the corresponding chapter.

## Usage
To run the solutions, you will need Python along with several common data science packages. It is recommended to create a virtual environment and install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The **requirements.txt** file contains the necessary dependencies, such as:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StatLearning-Exercises.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired chapter and open the Jupyter notebook or script for the exercise you want to work on.

## Notes
- I have added explanations to each solution to provide context and rationale for my approach.
- Solutions may not be optimal, and I welcome feedback or suggestions for improvement.
- The book contains many valuable insights, so I encourage you to read the corresponding chapter before tackling the exercises.
